# Daniel Mulitauopele - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I really wanted to push the envelope in terms of giving my best. I think that's been my whole goal for Turing in general, as I've lived most of my life coasting through. If you hadn't been pushed to the limit in Mod 1, Mod 2 will definitely do that for you. The workload was really heavy, and so I think I felt more down on myself in this mod than I did last mod. But that's exactly the type of scenario I needed in order to push myself.

## Posse Experience

I'm not sure if TAAAP counts as a posse or not, but I will say that my experience with TAAAP has been incredible. I've made connections with more people than I would have, and it genuinely feels like family. Two of my mentors are in TAAAP, and they've been so helpful to me. I'm learning a lot, and I feel like even after Turing, I'll have a great community of people to engage with on the daily.

## A: End of Module Assessment

I mean, I hope I passed. Although I wouldn't be surprised if I didn't. I really do feel like that curve trend you guys show in the beginning applies, because I don't feel like I started to get it until the very very end.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Not sure what goes here in the intro, but the only individual project we did was the Rails Mini, and I felt like that was the hardest one for me. It was meant to be a voting app, but I couldn't actually get the voting functionality working. The shell of what is needed is there though.

#### (OpenSphere)

* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

The project was meant to be a voting app, designed to address some of the issues with voter participation that we see today.

In terms of comments received, there were not many as it was just a show and tell. The instructors did ask about what relationships I built into the app, which were hard for me to grasp.

I'd give myself a 6/10 on this project.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

These are the projects that I worked on with different people.

#### (Little Shop, Job Tracker, Bike Share)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/DanielMulitauopele/job-tracker)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/DanielMulitauopele/bike_share)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/bike-share-redux)

I think my performance in these project went better over time. The first project was ok, but we messed with code the day of evaluation and ruined our project. It was a learning experience. Job Tracker was paired, and it helped me understand what it means to take the lead and try to keep morale up when things aren't going so well. Bike Share was all about how to function well on a team with different personalities, and recognizing what makes someone who they are, even if that clashes with your own personality. Despite our initial struggles, the Bike Share project was most successful.

I appreciated the check ins that came with Bike Share. It felt like a real working environment and I felt like it helped keep the morale up, even when the comments were negative. The other projects, I felt like I received the majority of instructor feedback at the end. I don't feel like it was helpful.

I think we got a barely passing grade on Little Shop, and the same for Job Tracker. Bike Share? I'm not sure yet, we will see.

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I feel like I've had many good conversations recently about race and privilege with students, and I feel like those conversations have changed the perspective of my peers. It's hard to do that, but it always feels worthwhile. I've also tried to be active on Twitter and boost Turing's presence in any way that I can.
